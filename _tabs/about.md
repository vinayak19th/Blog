I’m a PhD student exploring the exciting world of Quantum Machine Learning, where I love turning complex theory into real-world impact. Before grad school, I worked as a Deep Learning Developer at Myelin Foundry, building smart edge-AI solutions for everyday challenges. Now I’m digging into new machine learning algorithms designed to boost NISQ computer performance at the MPS Lab. My goal? To finish my PhD and help move Quantum Machine Learning forward—bringing fresh ideas to this rapidly growing field at the crossroads of physics, AI, and computer science.
