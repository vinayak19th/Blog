## Welcome to My Quantum Machine Learning Journey 🚀✨

Hello, and welcome to my personal blog! 🎉

I'm Vinayak Sharma—a driven PhD student at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. My passion lies in bridging theory and real-world application, especially as we stand on the brink of a quantum revolution. ⚛️🤖

### Who Am I? 👨‍🎓

With a background in deep learning and hands-on experience as a developer at Myelin Foundry, I've devoted my academic path to the study of Quantum Machine Learning. Currently, my research at the MPS-Lab focuses on designing machine learning algorithms that can enhance the performance of NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) computers. I believe this emerging, interdisciplinary field will reshape our technological future, and I'm excited to contribute to its growth and evolution. 🌱🔬
